## Overview

FedEx Ground was in need of a location in Anchorage, AK to accommodate their delivery chain but was unable to find a suitable location. Keith Mathias of KAM Coastal, through research and due diligence, located and purchased a 3.1-acre parcel near the airport that was compliant with stringent TSA security requirements.

From concept to completion, KAM Coastal was responsible for the entire development process, including project scope definition, design requirements, stakeholder collaboration, lease negotiations, and construction management. The project was delivered on time and on budget, allowing FedEx to prepare for their peak season schedule.

Built in 2005, the facility includes approximately 2,450 square feet of conditioned office space and specialized package sorting capabilities. In 2014, the building was expanded by an additional 11,000 square feet to accommodate increased facility demands and TSA security requirements.
