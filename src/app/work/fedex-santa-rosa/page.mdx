## Overview

KAM Coastal acted as the purchasing broker for this 10-acre property in Santa Rosa, California, and served as the development partner and building project manager for the FedEx Ground hub design/build project.

From concept to completion, KAM Coastal was responsible for defining project scope, budget and schedule, design requirements, stakeholder collaboration, lease negotiations, and construction management. This $10M development project was delivered on time and on budget, allowing FedEx to prepare for their peak season schedule.

Completed in 2007, the facility is located off Highway 101 and Shiloh Oaks road in Windsor, California. The building includes approximately 4,150 square feet of conditioned office space and serves the day-to-day FedEx Ground operations for Sonoma, Marin, Napa, and Lake Counties. Due to the project's success and strategic location, an expansion of 18,300 square feet was completed in 2011.
