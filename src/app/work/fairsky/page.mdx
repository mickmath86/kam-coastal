## Overview

In 1999 KAM Coastal partnered with The Rottman Group of Santa Barbara, CA in their first joint venture to build a technology park in Santa Maria, California. KAM Coastal was responsible for the development, construction, leasing, and sale of all seven buildings in the park.

Completed in 2002, FairSky Technology Park was the first speculated commercial business park in Northern Santa Barbara County since the 1980s. This 141,000-square-foot Planned Development Business Park features 7 buildings on a 10-acre master planned site.

The buildings range in size from 16,800 square feet to 23,000 square feet and are located on their own parcel to allow the individual sale of each building within the park. The project is zoned M-1 for light industrial, with office space comprising 70% of the floor space.
